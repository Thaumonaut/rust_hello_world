# Overview

This project is just a simple hello world application where I parse the user's name from input and properly format it before outputing "Hello, {Name}" to the terminal. This is to help me learn how to work with strings in Rust for upcoming projects. 

# Development Environment

I am using Rust with rustrover to help me build this application as I find it provided the best experience when developing with the rust language.
