# Overview

With this project, I want to learn how to parse a file and convert it into another file type. In this case I am converting a markdown into HTML. In the future I hope to use this knowledge to create my markup language that can be converted into html components similar to svelte.

# Development Environment

I am using Rust with rustrover to help me build this application as I find it provided the best experience when developing with the rust language. I am using the Pest package to help with parsing the files so I can learn how to use it for later projects.
